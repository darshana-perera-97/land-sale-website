## How to Add Chatbot to Other Pages

### Method 1: Include External Files (Recommended)
To add the chatbot to any other HTML page, add these references:

1. **CSS Link** (add to `<head>` section):
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="chatbot/chatbot.css">
   ```

2. **JavaScript Reference** (add before closing `</body>` tag):
   ```html
   <script src="chatbot/chatbot.js"></script>
   ```

3. **HTML Structure** (add before closing `</body>` tag):
   - Copy the HTML structure from `./chatbot/chatbot-component.html`
   - Or copy the chatbot HTML section from `index.html` or `index2.html`
